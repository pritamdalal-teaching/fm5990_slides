## Context

- \emph{Options} are simple financial contracts that show up everywhere in finance.
\vspace{10pt}
- They can be viewed as the building blocks of many other financial instruments.
\vspace{10pt}
- The theory of option pricing is the starting point for much of quantitative finance.
\vspace{10pt}
- Most of the data that we are going to analyze in this class will be options related.
\vspace{10pt}
- \textbf{Bottom Line:} You need to understand options.


## Options are Insurance Contracts

- \textbf{Options} are simple \textbf{insurance} contracts wrapped around other financial assets.
\vspace{10pt}
- The financial asset that is being insured is called the \emph{underlying}.
\vspace{1pt}
- The types of underlyings that we are going to discuss in this class will mostly be stocks and ETFs.  
\vspace{10pt}
- The essential concepts are the same for other underlyings like interest rates, futures, or barrels of oil. 
\vspace{10pt}
- Let's build some intuition using a type of insurance that you are all familiar with: car insurance.


## Wolve Auto Insurance

- Wolverine Trading wants to get into the car insurance business.  They would like our help with formulating a pricing policy.
\vspace{10pt}
- The type of underlying they want to insure: a specific driver coupled with a specifc vehicle.
\vspace{10pt}
- The driver being insured is going to pay Wolve \emph{premium}.
\vspace{10pt}
- In exchange for premium, Wolve will reimburse the driver whenever damage to the car exceeds a certain dollar amount, called the \emph{strike} (deductible).
\vspace{10pt}
- **Intuition Check:** Do you think Wolverine should charge the same premium irrespective of the underlying?



## Price of Underlying

- Sandra has two different vehicles that she wants to switch over to Wolve Auto insurance.
\vspace{10pt}
- One is an old busted Mazda 3 that she bought several years ago when she was a struggling MFM instructor.
\vspace{10pt}
- The other is a fancy new self-driving Tesla that she bought last week after starting her lucrative options trading career.
\vspace{10pt}
- **Intuition Check:** Which one should be more expensive to insure? Why?  


## Strike Price of Contract


- Wolve Auto has three different strikes that they can offer Sandra for the insurance on her self-driving Tesla:
    * \emph{at-the-money} $:=$ \$0
    * \$1,000
    * \$5,000
\vspace{15pt}  
- **Exercise:** Order the premium for the three strike prices from cheapest to most expensive. Explain.


## Time to Expiration (Tenor) of Contract

- Wolve has three different contract lengths that they can offer Sandra for her Tesla insurance:
    * 0.25 years
    * 0.50 years
    * 1.00 years
\vspace{15pt}
- **Exericise:** Order the premium for these tenors from most expensive to least expensive.  Explain.


## Volatility of Underlying

- Wolve is pricing insurance for two different customers, Sally and Patty.
\vspace{15pt}
- Both Sally and Patty are looking to purchase insurance a fancy new self-driving Tesla.   They both want a 1-year contract with with a $1,000 strike price.
\vspace{15pt}
- Here is how Sally's friends describe her: calm, chill, responsible, quiet, serene.
\vspace{15pt}
- Here is how Patty's friends describe her: wild, hyper, flakey, loud, volatile.
\vspace{15pt}
- **Intuition Check:** Who should Wolverine charge more for insurance? Why?


## Insurance Payoff Graph (1 of 3)

- It's 8a on a Saturday morning.  Sally is driving on the freeway on her way to CrossFit, hands at 10-2, eyes on the road, listening to classical music.
\vspace{10pt}
- Patty, also driving on the freeway, is on her way home from an all night rave.  As she is driving, she is blasting Bassnectar and posting to her IG story.
\vspace{10pt}
- Suddenly, Patty loses control and swerves in front Sally...(freeze tape)
\vspace{10pt}
- Patty is riding dirty with no insurance, but Sally purchased a $1000-strike contract before she left the dealership.
\vspace{10pt}
- \textbf{Excercise:} Graph the value of Sally's insurance payoff as a function of the damage to her vehicle from the accident.



## Insurance Payoff Graph (2 of 3)


```{r}
strike <- 1000 
damage <- seq(0, 3000, 500)
payoff <- pmax(damage - strike, 0)
heading <- "insurance payoff"
plot(damage, payoff, type="n", main="Payoff to Sally")
lines(damage, payoff, type="l")
```


## Insurance Payoff Graph (3 of 3)

- The payoff graph we created was from Sally's perspective.  
\vspace{15pt}
- **Intuition Check:** What does the graph look like from Wolverine's perspective?
\vspace{15pt}
- \textbf{Jargon:} We say that Sally is long (bought) the insurance contract and that Wolverine is short (sold) the insurance contract.
