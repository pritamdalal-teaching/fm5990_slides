## Motivation

- \textbf{Data analysis} is a \textbf{crucial skill} for quantitative professionals.
\vspace{10pt}
- \emph{Quants} are being replaced by \emph{Data Scientists}.
\vspace{10pt}
- MFM graduates are increasingly working in data analysis roles.
\vspace{10pt}
- This course is the MFM's response to the changing professional landscape.
\vspace{10pt}
- It is an \textbf{introductory treatment} of \textbf{R} and \textbf{Python} for data analysis in the context of \textbf{quantitative finance}.


## Course Specifics & Philosophy

- Tuesdays from 5:30p-7:10p in Vincent 364.
\vspace{10pt}
- 2 credits pass/fail - let's focus on learning not grades.
\vspace{10pt}
- Learning data science on toy data sucks.
\vspace{10pt}
- Learning data science on cool data is awesome.  
\vspace{10pt}
- \textbf{Theorem:} awesome > sucks.  \textbf{Proof:} Exercise.
\vspace{10pt}
- \textbf{Corrollary:} All in-class examples, projects, and assignments are going to involve real world financial data.
\vspace{10pt}
- A big \textbf{{\color{green}THANKS}} to our industry data partners.

## Wolverine Analysis Project (1 of 3)

- Wolverine Trading is a option market maker. \textbf{What???}
\vspace{5pt}
- Let's say you wanted to trade a particular option, and that Wolverine is a market-maker for that option.   
\vspace{5pt}
- This means that you can call up Wolverine and ask them what their \emph{market} is for that option. (Note: you haven't told them if you want to buy or sell.)
\vspace{5pt}
- \textbf{Wolverine's Market:} A price at which they would sell the option \emph{-and simultaneously-} a price at which they would buy the option. 
\vspace{5pt}
- The price at which they are willing to buy is their \textbf{bid price}.
\vspace{5pt}
- The price at which they are willing to sell is their \textbf{ask price}.
    * Question: Which is higher the bid or the ask?
    
    
## Wolverine Analysis Project (2 of 3)

- On any given day, Wolverine is a market maker for literally hundreds of thousands of options.
\vspace{10pt}
- The way they make money is by buying and selling lots of different options, with their bids being lower than their asks.
\vspace{10pt}
- All the while, they hope they don't accumulate large positions in any one option or underlying (AAPL, FB, GOOG).  
\vspace{10pt}
- If they do accumulate positions, which is inevitable in their business, they hope that the underlying stock doesn't move too much, as this could result in significant losses.

## Wolverine Analysis Project (3 of 3)

- Companies who's stock can be owned by anyone (AAPL, FB, GOOG) are highly regulated.
\vspace{10pt}
- They are required to publicly report their profitability once per quarter.  This is called their \emph{quarterly earnings report}.
\vspace{10pt}
- What do you think happens to the companies stock price around the time of their earnings report?
\vspace{10pt}
- This is a time of \textbf{\color{red}high risk} for option market-makers.
\vspace{10pt}
- Wolverine has tasked us with analyzing the price movement of stocks in the days following their earnings reports.
\vspace{10pt}
- \textbf{How:} We will use the data that Wolverine has provided. We will also repeat the analysis using the Delta Neutral data and make sure they lead to similar conclusions.
